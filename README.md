Latest vaccination data:

Animations are generally tweeted by [@chriswithers13](https://twitter.com/chriswithers13).

Static charts are in the [notebooks](https://github.com/cjw296/coronavirus/blob/master/coronavirus.ipynb), just view them on GitHub.

Charts and interactive plots, other than vaccination data, are infrequently updated, 
often when code changes.

Code is here: [https://github.com/cjw296/coronavirus](https://github.com/cjw296/coronavirus)

Interactive plot is available on [here](https://cjw296.github.io/coronavirus/zoe_phe.html), 
but I'd recommend Russ Garrett's [excellent map](https://russss.github.io/covidtracker/map.html) instead.
