Exploring UK data on coronovirus cases.

Animations are generally tweeted by [@chriswithers13](https://twitter.com/chriswithers13).

Static charts are in the [notebooks](https://github.com/cjw296/coronavirus/blob/master/coronavirus.ipynb), just view them on GitHub.

Charts and interactive plots infrequently updated, often when code changes.

Code is here: https://github.com/cjw296/coronavirus

Interactive plot is available on [here](https://cjw296.github.io/coronavirus/zoe_phe.html), 
but I'd recommend Russ Garrett's [excellent map](https://russss.github.io/covidtracker/map.html) instead.

There also another [excellent map](https://visual.parliament.uk/research/visualisations/coronavirus-restrictions-map/) of currently Coronavirus restrictions in the UK, including local ones.
